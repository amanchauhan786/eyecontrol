# EyeControl

A simple Python-based tool for controlling applications or interacting with your system using eye gestures or eye tracking inputs. Designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly customizable.

## Features

- Real-time eye-tracking control using a webcam or eye-tracker  
- Trigger commands or actions based on eye movements or gaze patterns  
- Lightweight and modular design for easy extension  
- Customizable: define your own commands and gestures  

---

## How It Works

The project likely follows these steps (assuming typical eye-control workflows):

1. Capture video feed from a webcam or eye-tracker.  
2. Detect and track eye positions or gaze vectors using computer vision techniques.  
3. Map detected eye movements or gestures to specific commands.  
4. Execute the mapped actions on your system or applications.  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python — core language  
- OpenCV — video capture and facial/eye detection  
- (Optional) eye-tracking libraries like `dlib`, `mediapipe`, or others  
- Other supportive libraries (e.g., NumPy, OS, subprocess)  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed  
- Computer with a webcam or compatible eye-tracker installed  
- Optional: necessary drivers or SDKs for eye-tracking hardware  

### Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanchauhan786/eyecontrol.git
cd eyecontrol
````

Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required packages (modify as needed based on your dependencies):

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## How to Use

Usage instructions will depend on how your project is structured. Here's a general template:

```bash
python main.py
```

1. Allow access to your webcam (or eye-tracker).
2. Define or configure eye gestures and corresponding commands.
3. Run the script and control the system using your eyes.
4. Press a key (e.g., `q`) to quit.

## Project Structure

```
eyecontrol/
├── main.py                # Core script to capture and process eye gestures
├── gesture_config.py      # Optional: for defining gesture-command mappings
└── requirements.txt       # Optional: list of project dependencies
```

---

## Future Improvements

* Add more robust eye-detection methods (e.g., MediaPipe)
* Gesture customization via external config file or GUI
* Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
* Logging or visual feedback for detection and commands
* Support for external eye-tracking hardware (Tobii, Pupil Labs, etc.)

```
